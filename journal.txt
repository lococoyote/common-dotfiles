2019-01-25 09:03 SO, today is the day I start this thing for real.
I hope to capture current events as well as older incidents...let's see how it goes.

Biggest news of the year so far is that on 8 Jan I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. My A1C was over 13% and my daily blood sugar levels were in the 300 to 400 range. Very bad stuff. However, I have manged to get it under control..daily averages now are in the 120 to 150 range. I expect it will drop lower as I lose weight and continue eating reasonably. I am on Metformin 500mg twice daily right now.

It looked bad at first, but I got this....

2019-02-17 21:20 nothing new to report...

2019-02-21 10:31 So, as I could have guessed, I have been less than steady in writing the journal.
Let's see if I can get back on track...

2019-03-21 13:39 I spent a bit over twenty years of my adult life as a soldier.
I joined at a time when I had youthful convictions of conservative direction and loved my country dearly. In those days I was sure there was nothing more pure and noble than the Untied States of America. I took basic at Ft Dix in New Jersey and following that, AIT at Knox. My first duty assignment was to 1/36 Infantry in Friedberg, Germany. Third Armored Division, third brigade. Spartans. Those were they days of the Cold War and with Europe being on the front line, we got the best of everything...all the newest toys and equipment.  But I digress...

During my time as a soldier, I met a great many people from all walks of life. Anyone who knows me, can tell you that I am not a people kind of person. But despite this, I formed bonds with those I served with.
