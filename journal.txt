2019-01-25 09:03 SO, today is the day I start this thing for real.
I hope to capture current events as well as older incidents...let's see how it goes.

Biggest news of the year so far is that on 8 Jan I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. My A1C was over 13% and my daily blood sugar levels were in the 300 to 400 range. Very bad stuff. However, I have manged to get it under control..daily averages now are in the 120 to 150 range. I expect it will drop lower as I lose weight and continue eating reasonably. I am on Metformin 500mg twice daily right now.

It looked bad at first, but I got this....

2019-02-17 21:20 nothing new to report...

2019-02-21 10:31 So, as I could have guessed, I have been less than steady in writing the journal.
Let's see if I can get back on track...
